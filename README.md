# Important Notice

This repository contains sample code implementations for educational purposes only. It is not intended to be used as a solution for CS50 problem sets or any other academic assignments. Using this code to solve problem sets would constitute academic dishonesty and violate the policies of CS50 and Harvard University.

CS50's honor code states: "We do not tolerate academic dishonesty." (https://cs50.net/honor-code/)

Harvard University's policy on academic integrity can be found at:
https://www.harvard.edu/policies/academic-integrity/

Using someone else's work without proper attribution is considered plagiarism and can result in severe penalties, including failure in the course and potential expulsion from Harvard University.

Always write your own code solutions for problem sets and assignments. This repository is meant to serve as an educational resource, not as a shortcut to completing coursework.
